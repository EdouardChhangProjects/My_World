Map is composed of two maps: one for the point and one for the texture

first map is a 2D array with the 2-digit value representing the Z axis.
Each tile is separated by a space and each line by a newline.

Ex:

01 01 01
02 02 02
03 03 03

Then there is the other array, it represents the texture used.
It needs to smaller by one on both the height and width.
They are separated by a @.

So a map would look like:

Ex:
01 01 01
02 02 02
03 03 03@01 02
03 04
